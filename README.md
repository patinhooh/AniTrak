## Project Overview 🎡

The AniList CLI Project is a command-line tool built in C for tracking anime viewing progress by interacting with the AniList API. The primary goal of this project is to deepen understanding of advanced C programming concepts while building a practical application.

### Focus Areas: 🔍

- **GraphQL Integration:** Communicating with the AniList API using GraphQL queries.
- **CLI Tool Development:** Building a user-friendly command-line interface.
- **Efficient Data Handling:** Implementing JSON parsing and data caching techniques.
- **Learning and Exploration:** Strengthening knowledge of C fundamentals and exploring advanced features like memory management and API interactions.

### Goals ⭐

- Develop a simple yet powerful CLI tool for anime tracking.
- Practice working with APIs using modern communication protocols.
- Enhance skills in C programming and system-level development.

### Plans 📝

- Enable full functionality to manage anime tracking via the CLI, including:
- Searching for anime by title, ID, or using filters and sorting options similar to the AniList website
- Viewing detailed information about anime
- Tracking watch status (planned, watching, completed, dropped)
- Adding or removing anime from lists
- Viewing user statistics
- Updating episode progress
- Managing custom lists and tags
- Supporting user authentication for personalized data access
- Caching results to minimize API calls
